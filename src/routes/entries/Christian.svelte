        <p>When papa found out that Christian would have</p>
        <p>a pussy,</p>
        <p>she became Christine Joy.</p>
        <p>When Christine Joy was born,</p>
        <p>the full tuft of hair on her head made mama worried her baby</p>
        <p>would look too much like a boy.</p>
        <p>And so,</p>
        <p>at barely 1 years old,</p>
        <p>Christine Joy received pierced ears and pearl earrings...</p>
        <p>How ironic is it</p>
        <p>that 2 decades later</p>
        <p>Christine would find their way to be Chris</p>
